# Titanic-dataset
In this project I will be creating a machine learning model on the famous Titanic dataset, which is used by many people all over the world. It provides information on the fate of passengers on the Titanic, summarized according to economic status (class), sex, age and survival. The “Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster” Competition. In this challenge, we are asked to predict whether a passenger on the titanic would have been survived or not. https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data
